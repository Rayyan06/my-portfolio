<!-- Intro Paragraph -->

<p class="text-xl text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
CNC machines can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of these applications is a CNC machine to cut foam. I designed and built a 4-axis hot-wire CNC machine capable of cutting complex, tapered wing sections from foam blocks with high accuracy.

<!-- Section: Build Process -->

<div>
<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 tracking-tight">The Build Process</h2>
<p class="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-600">The machine's frame was designed in Fusion 360, with all brackets and motor mounts 3D printed in PETG for strength. The linear motion is handled by NEMA 17 stepper motors driving carriages along aluminum extrusions. Each side has an independent X and Y axis, allowing the machine to cut tapered shapes where the wing root and tip profiles are different.</p>

<p class="mt-8 text-lg text-slate-600">The hot wire is tensioned with a spring system to account for thermal expansion during a cut. Power is supplied by a modified computer PSU, with the temperature controlled via a PWM signal from the Arduino.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 tracking-tight">Sample G-Code</h2>
<p class="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-600">The machine is controlled by standard G-code, generated by software like DevWing Foam. Here is a small sample snippet that defines the start of a cut for a simple airfoil shape.</p>

<!-- Section: Conclusion -->

<div>
<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 tracking-tight">Challenges & Conclusion</h2>
<p class="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-600">This was a challenging but incredibly rewarding build. Calibrating the four axes to move in perfect synchronization was the most difficult part, requiring a lot of trial and error. The final machine, however, produces perfectly smooth and accurate foam cores every time.</p>
<p class="mt-4 text-lg text-slate-600">Future plans include adding a turntable to allow for 3D fuselage cutting and upgrading the control board to a more powerful 32-bit option for smoother motion.</p>
